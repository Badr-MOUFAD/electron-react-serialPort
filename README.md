# Electron React Serialport (Template App)

# Presentation
This repository provides a template for creating Desktop Apps using UI web frameworks.

I mainly created this template for robotics projects, particularly to build ergonomic user interfaces to exchange easily with a microcontroller.

When using this template, you have access not only to lower system API such as serial port communication to send command to `Arduino` but also to UIs web frameworks such `React`, `Bootstrap`, ... to leverage the power of the web and thereby create astonishing UIs.
